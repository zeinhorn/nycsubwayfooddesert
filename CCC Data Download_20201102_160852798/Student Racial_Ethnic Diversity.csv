"Name","Student Racial/Ethnic Diversity"
"Description","Diversity refers to the racial/ethnic makeup of students at schools within a specific geography, using the DOE's categories of Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and Multiple Race Categories Not Represented. School diversity is determined in the following way:<br />
- Diverse (No one group exceeds 50 percent and no two groups exceed 80 percent*);<br />
- Predominantly White (White students make up 50+ percent and no other group exceeds 20 percent);<br />
- Predominantly Asian (Asian students make up 50+ percent and no other group exceeds 20 percent);<br />
- Predominantly White + Asian (White and Asian students make up 80+ percent combined);<br />
- Predominantly Black (Black students make up 50+ percent and no other group exceeds 20 percent);<br />
- Predominantly Hispanic (Hispanic students make up 50+ percent and no other group exceeds 20 percent);<br />
- Predominantly Black + Hispanic (Black and Hispanic students make up 80+ percent combined).<br />
<br />
*Of the schools classified as 'Diverse,' a very small number are more than 80 percent Asian + Hispanic or more than 80 percent White + Hispanic."
